IBM Task 2: Modern Login UI 

This project is part of my internship assignment for IBM, where I was asked to design a modern login interface using front-end technologies.

I went beyond the basic requirements to create a visually pleasing and responsive login page that features:

A soothing animated gradient background

A clean glassmorphic card-style form

Functional JavaScript-based login validation

The goal was to combine aesthetic design with functional coding, while keeping the layout simple, responsive, and professional.

I hope you enjoy viewing it as much as I enjoyed building it.
